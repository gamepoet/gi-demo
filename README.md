# gi-demo

I read this blog post, http://copypastepixel.blogspot.com/2017/04/real-time-global-illumination.html, and decided to see how far I could get trying to replicate the results by starting from scratch. The code is intentionally a mess. :-p

## TODO
- add a light (forward-rendered)
- make it possible to move the light
- add materials to the elements of the cornell box
